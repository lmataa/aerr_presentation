# SACS presentation

## Repo organization

  - The [`papers`](./papers) directory contains the main papers in which the presentation is based.
  - The [`notes`](./notes) directory contains a LaTeX project with the notes for the presentation, also compiled in [`notes/notes.pdf`](./notes/notes.pdf). The idea is that the slides will summarize this information and we can also deliver this document for completion.

## Current status

We have a draft of the notes for the presentation without the technical part, but 
it should be reviewed by more member teams in order to find any possible improvement:

  - Corrections.
  - Missing or unnecessary information.
  - Confusing parts.
  - Better ways of exposing the topic.
  - Etc.

## Pending

  - Review the current notes for the presentation.
  - Expand the technical part corresponding to the second approach to model types not in depth but enough to present it.
  - Do the slides based on the notes for the presentation.
