# SACS presentation

## Repo organization

  - The [`papers`](./papers) directory contains the main papers in which the presentation is based.
  - The [`notes`](./notes) directory contains a LaTeX project with the notes for the presentation, also compiled in [`notes/notes.pdf`](./notes/notes.pdf). The idea is that the slides will summarize this information and we can also deliver this document for completion.
  - The [`presentation`](./presentation) directory contains a Pandoc project to generate the slides of the presentation.

## Current status

The notes for the presentation are in a stable state and we are currently preparing the slides for them.

## Pending

  - Review the current notes for the presentation.
  - Do the slides based on the notes for the presentation.
