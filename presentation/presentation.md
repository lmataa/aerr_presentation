\section{Foundational Proof Carrying Code}
\label{pcc}

# Foundational Proof Carrying Code (FPCC)

In 1996, a Gorge Necula's paper [@necula:pcc] introduces the idea of Proof-Carrying code:

1. **Code producer**: generate an executable together with a proof that the program adheres to some safety policy
   
2. **Code consumer**: receives an untrusted executable and validate it before running it.

# Foundational Proof Carrying Code (FPCC)

The idea is  about type systems for machine code (i.e. a deductive system defined over  machine instructions which is proved to guarantee or preserve some properties).

\begin{center}
\textit{
  A framework for mechanical verification of safety 
  properties of machine language...
}
\end{center}

until here it is Proof-Carrying Code

\begin{center}
\textit{
  ...with the smallest possible runtime and verifier.
}
\end{center}

and this last part is the Foundational one.

# Foundational Proof Carrying Code (FPCC)

At that moment, they chose Twelf for defining the logic and
the required encodings, this is just an example to 
illustrate how it looks like:


# Foundational Proof Carrying Code (FPCC)

One of the parts that must be modeled within this logic is 
the target machine architecture. The behavior (i.e. 
semantic) and encoding (i.e. syntax) of machine 
instructions must be defined, and they believe that it is
possible for every usual architecture in a similar way 
(i.e. as a step relation $(r,m) \mapsto (r',m')$ where $r$ 
and $r'$ are states of the register bank and $m$ and $m'$ 
of the memory).


# Foundational Proof Carrying Code (FPCC)

For example, they encoded the SPARK 
architecture by means of 1035 Twelf LOC for the syntactic 
part, generated with a 151 LOC of a higher level language 
due to redundancies, and 600 Twelf LOC for the semantic 
one. This is an example of an \textit{add} instruction 
encoding:

\begin{align*}
  \mathsf{add}(i, j, k) = \;\;\;\;&\\ 
    \lambda r,m,r',m'.\;&r'(i) = r(j) + r(k) \\
      &\land (\forall x \neq i.\;r'(x) = r(x)) \\
      &\land m' = m \\
\end{align*}

# Foundational Proof Carrying Code (FPCC)

Safety requirements can be specified in the syntax and 
semantics themselves, by making the step relation 
deliberately partial or by making some syntax forbidden 
just by not defining it. This is a dumb example of the 
previous instruction to be not allowed for a certain 
register:

\begin{align*}
  \mathsf{add}(i, j, k) = \;\;\;\;&\\ 
    \lambda r,m,r',m'.\;&r'(i) = r(j) + r(k) \\
      &\land (\forall x \neq i.\;r'(x) = r(x)) \\
      &\land m' = m \\
      &\land i \neq 42 \\
\end{align*}

# Foundational Proof Carrying Code (FPCC)

One of the most challenging parts has been to find an 
appropriate model for encoding type systems. Its first 
approach [@appel:fpcc:semantic] was to model types as 
sets of values, and model values in a direct way like a 
pair consisting of the memory and a memory address, but 
they encounter some limitations:

\begin{itemize}
  \item They were unable to model mutable fields.
  \item They were unable to model certain kinds of 
    recursive datatype definitions.
\end{itemize}

# Foundational Proof Carrying Code (FPCC)

Their second approach [@appel:fpcc:indexed] was to 
model types as sets of pairs $\langle k, v \rangle$ where 
$k$ is an approximation index and $v$ a value. The 
judgement $\langle k, v \rangle \in \tau$ means informally 
that $v$ can be considered to have type $\tau$ for a 
program running for less than $k$ steps. This model solved 
their problem with recursion, but the one with mutable 
fields remained. A PhD thesis of a student of A.W. Appel 
offered later a model which solved also that problem.

\section{Interlude}
\label{interlude}

# Interlude

Ten years later, A.W. Appel says that now it is practical 
to prove safety and correctness with type systems for 
source code instead of machine code and they are 
trustworthy if compiled with a formally verified compiler
[@appel:fpcc:compilers], so he is now involved in 
projects of this kind (e.g. CertiCoq 
[@website:certicoq], CompCert [@website:compcert], 
CertiKOS [@website:certikos]).

# Interlude

However, although the results of this research seem to 
have not so much practical interest nowadays, we want to
show how they encoded type systems in a foundational way, 
which is not only applicable to type systems for machine 
code as they show for example with a usual typed lambda 
calculus.

\label{foundational_types}

# A Foundational Model for Types


The first key insight of FPCC -and of PCC in reality- 
is realizing that you can write type-inference rules
for machine language and states, for example:

\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$m\vdash x:\tau_1\times\tau_2$}
\UnaryInfC{$m\vdash m(x):\tau_1\wedge m(x+1):\tau_2$}
\end{prooftree}

which means that if $x$ has type $\tau_1\times\tau_2$ 
-meaning a pointer to a pair of those types-, then 
the contents of direction $x$ will be of type $\tau_1$ 
and the contents of direction $x+1$ will be of type 
$\tau_2$. We can even add safety policies into the mix:

\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$m\vdash x:\tau_1\times\tau_2$}
\UnaryInfC{$\mathsf{readable}(x)
  \wedge\mathsf{readable}(x+1)
  \wedge m\vdash m(x):\tau_1\wedge m(x+1):\tau_2$}
\end{prooftree}

# A Foundational Model for Types

The second key insight of FPCC -which really makes it 
foundational-,  is realizing that instead of looking
at this from a syntactical standpoint we can do it 
from a semantical standpoint. Viewing things from a 
syntactic standpoint is significantly harder as they
only allow subject-reduction over a set of axiomatic 
syntactic rules. 

Using semantics, however, allows us
to have these expressions as lemmas provable from 
their syntactic meaning instead of axioms. Let us 
define $m\vdash x:\tau$ as an application of predicate
$\tau$ on memory $m$ and integer (or address) $x$.
So $m\vdash x:\tau \equiv \tau (m)(x)$. 

# A Foundational Model for Types

To note the change from syntactic semantic we shall note the 
types as $\models x:\tau$ We can now give the 
semantic meaning to the rules written before of:
\begin{align*}
  \mathsf{record}(\tau_1,\tau_2)mx=&\\
  &\mathsf{readable}(x)\wedge\mathsf{readable}(x+1)\\
  &\wedge \models m(x):\tau_1, m(x+1):\tau_2
\end{align*}

Which not only allows us to prove the expressions
that we've already seen but also:

\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$\mathsf{readable}(x)$}
\AxiomC{$\mathsf{readable}(x+1)$}
\AxiomC{$\models m(x):\tau_1$}
\AxiomC{$\models m(x+1):\tau_2$}
\QuaternaryInfC{$\models x:\tau_1\times\tau_2$}
\end{prooftree}

\section{Indexed Model for Types}
\label{indexed_types}

# Indexed Model for Types

The type system for FPCC that we have discussed has 
some issues, mainly in dealing with recursion. 
In order to solve them, we need a new definition for
type that lets us come with more advanced proofs.

A type is modeled as a set of pairs of the form 
$\langle k, v \rangle$ where $k$ is a nonnegative integer called 
index, $v$ is a value and it is closed under decreasing index 
(i.e.whenever $\langle k, v \rangle$ belongs to a type $\tau$, 
we also have that $\langle j, v \rangle$ belongs to 
$\tau$ for all $j \geq k$).

We write $e :_k \tau$ if $e \rightarrow^j v$ for some $j < k$ 
implies $\langle k - j, v\rangle \in \tau$, where $\rightarrow$ 
is the step relation given by the corresponding small step 
semantics.


# Indexed Model for Types

In each case, the type sets must be defined, but some conventional 
ones which do not depend on a specific use case are for example:

\begin{align*}
  \bot &\equiv \{\} \\ 
  \top &\equiv \{ \langle k, v \rangle\;|\; k \geq 0 \}
\end{align*}

Type environment and states are modeled respectively as mappings 
from variables to types and variables to values. The consistency 
of a state $\sigma$ and environment $\Gamma$ is written 
$\sigma :_k \Gamma$ and defined as $\forall x \in dom(\Gamma)$
we have $\sigma(x) :_k \Gamma(x)$.


# Indexed Model for Types


The entailment relation $\Gamma \models_k e$ is the semantic 
counterpart of a type judgement and means 
$\sigma(e):_k \alpha$ for all state $\sigma$ consistent with 
$\Gamma$, where $\sigma(e)$ is the result of replacing all the 
free variables of $e$ with their values i n $\sigma$. 

Also, 
$\Gamma \models e : \alpha$ means 
$\Gamma \models e :_k \alpha$ for all $k \geq 0$.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}


# Conclusion

- Foundational Proof Carrying Code seems to be out of interest nowadays, but it motivated a research about modeling type systems in a foundational way.

- To model types directly as sets of values was not enough for some features such as contravariant recursive definitions and mutable fields.

# Conclusion

- A more sophisticated model, which we are presenting here, allowed them to model better recursion, and further research seems to have solved even the problem they had about mutable fields.

- These results may help in studying type systems from the point of view of foundational mathematics and also where the introduction of rules must be correct within a logic in a machine-checkable way.
